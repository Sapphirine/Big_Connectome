Required libraries include: 
Now caffe and all its dependencies 
are required. 

h5dump, hdf5 libraries, libcurl 
and the standard Linux LAMP packages. 
Also, it is helpful to have the latest 
ffmpeg, libogg, libtheora, x264 and opencv installed. 
Also, it is required that opencv link with ffmpeg 
libraries and the plug-in codecs mentioned above. 

To build from source code:

cd to root directory or parent directory of src/ directory. 
Enter the command: 
sh build/build.sh

If all dependencies are met, then bin/ directory 
will be created with executables and jar files. 

Thank you!!!
