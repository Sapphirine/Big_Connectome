e6895-connectome is software for implementing 
a myriad of algorithms and services 
on electron microscopy brain scans. 
It was written initially as a final 
project for 

E6895: Advanced Big Data Analytics

a course at Columbia University. 
The software was started during 
Big Data Analytics. 

Thanks go to Professor Ching-Yung Lin 
and his Graduate Teaching Assistants. 

Required libraries include: 
h5dump, hdf5 libraries, libcurl 
and the standard Linux LAMP packages. 
Also, it is helpful to have the latest 
ffmpeg, libogg, libtheora, x264 and opencv installed. 
Also, it is required that opencv link with ffmpeg 
libraries and the plug-in codecs mentioned above. 

To build from source code:

go root directory containing the following subdirectories:
SERVICE, PREP, FEAT, GRAPH. 

Enter the command: 
sh ./build.sh

This command will compile executables and build jar files in-place. 
To build bin directory, go up one directory and enter the command: 
sh ./build.sh

Thank you!!!
