Ganita Brain is software for implementing 
a myriad of algorithms and services 
on electron microscopy brain scans. 
Initial development is an outgrowth 
of a course at Columbia University: 
E6893: Big Data Analytics. 
Project name: Brain Edge Detection. 

Thanks go to Professor Ching-Yung Lin 
and his Graduate Teaching Assistants. 

Required libraries include: 
h5dump, hdf5 libraries, libcurl 
and the standard Linux LAMP packages. 
Also, it is helpful to have the latest 
ffmpeg, libogg, libtheora, x264 and opencv installed. 
Also, it is required that opencv link with ffmpeg 
libraries and the plug-in codecs mentioned above. 

To build from source code:

go root directory containing the following subdirectories:
SERVICE, PREP, FEAT, GRAPH. 

Enter the command: 
sh ./build.sh
